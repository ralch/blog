#### Introduction

The Decorator pattern adds new functionality to an existing object
without altering its structure. It is a structural pattern as this pattern acts
as a wrapper to existing class.

The instanciate a decorator struct which decorates (wraps) the original object
and provides additional functionality keeping its methods signature intact.

#### Purpose

- Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- Decorators provide a flexible alternative to inheritance for extending
	functionality.
- Wrapping a present, putting it in a box, and wrapping the box.

#### Design Pattern Diagram

The Decorator Pattern has the following entities:

{{< figure src="/media/golang/design-patterns/decorator.gif" alt="Decorator Class Diagram" >}}

- `Component` defines the interface for objects that can have responsibilities added to them dynamically.
- `ConcreteComponent` defines an object to which additional responsibilities can be attached.
- `Decorator` maintains a reference to a Component object and defines an interface that conforms to Component's interface.
- `ConcreteDecorator` adds responsibilities to the component.

#### Implementation

We are explore the use of decorator pattern via following example in
which we will extend an existing object that fetches a data from web service.
We will decorate it by adding circuit breaker capabilities without changing the
struct interface.

Lets have a `Fetcher` interface that defines a contract for fetching some data
from different sources.

```Golang
// Args of fetching function
type Args map[string]string

// Data returned by fetch
type Data map[string]string

// Fetcher fetches a data from remote endpoint
type Fetcher interface {
	// Fetch fetches the data
	Fetch(args Args) (Data, error)
}
```

A concrete implementation of the `Fetcher` interface is the `Repository` struct
which provides some dummy data if the provided arguments are not empty, otherwise
returns an error. The `Repository` struct is a concrete component in the context
of The Decorator Pattern.

```Golang
// Repository of data
type Repository struct{}

// Fetch fetches data
func (r *Repository) Fetch(args Args) (Data, error) {
	if len(args) == 0 {
		return Data{}, fmt.Errorf("No arguments are provided")
	}

	data := Data{
		"user":     "root",
		"password": "swordfish",
	}
	fmt.Printf("Repository fetched data successfully: %v\n", data)
	return data, nil
}
```

A `Retrier` struct is the decorator that adds circuit breaker capabilities to
any component that implements the `Fetcher` interface. The `Retrier` has a few
properties that allow that. The `RetryCount` property defines the number of times
that the retrier should try to fetch if there is an error. The `WaitInterval`
property defines the interval between every retry. The `Fetcher` property is
points to the object that is decorated. The `Retrier` calls the `Fetch`
function of the decorated object until it succeeds or exceed the retry policy.

```Golang
// Retrier retries multiple times
type Retrier struct {
	RetryCount   int
	WaitInterval time.Duration
	Fetcher      Fetcher
}

// Fetch fetches data
func (r *Retrier) Fetch(args Args) (Data, error) {
	for retry := 1; retry <= r.RetryCount; retry++ {
		fmt.Printf("Retrier retries to fetch for %d\n", retry)
		if data, err := r.Fetcher.Fetch(args); err == nil {
			fmt.Printf("Retrier fetched for %d\n", retry)
			return data, nil
		} else if retry == r.RetryCount {
			fmt.Printf("Retrier failed to fetch for %d times\n", retry)
			return Data{}, err
		}
		fmt.Printf("Retrier is waiting after error fetch for %v\n", r.WaitInterval)
		time.Sleep(r.WaitInterval)
	}

	return Data{}, nil
}
```

Then we can add the new retry capabilities by wrapping the `Repository` instance
with the `Retrier`:

```Golang
repository := &cbreaker.Repository{}
retrier := &cbreaker.Retrier{
	RetryCount:   5,
	WaitInterval: time.Second,
	Fetcher:      repository,
}

data, err := repository.Fetch(cbreaker.Args{"id": "1"})
fmt.Printf("#1 repository.Fetch: %v\n", data)

data, err = retrier.Fetch(cbreaker.Args{})
fmt.Printf("#2 retrier.Fetch error: %v\n", err)

data, err = retrier.Fetch(cbreaker.Args{"id": "1"})
fmt.Printf("#3 retrier.Fetch: %v\n", data)
```

#### Verdict

The Decorator Pattern is more convenient for adding functionalities to objects
instead of entire structs at runtime. With decoration it is also possible to
remove the added functionalities dynamically.
